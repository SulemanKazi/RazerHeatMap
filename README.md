# RazerHeatMap
A heatmapping application for Razer Keyboards using OpenRazer.

IMPORTANT: This application changes LEDs on your Razer keyboard, I don't know what the effect of frequently changing the lighting is on the keyboard hardware or software, so use at your own risk. It might burn out your keyboard LEDs or make your pet tarantula an epilepsy fit.
